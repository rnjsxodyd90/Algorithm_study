class Solution:
    def minStartValue(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        # Initialize min_val to track the minimum cumulative sum encountered
        min_val = 0
        # Initialize total to accumulate the sum of elements in nums
        total = 0
        # Iterate through each number in nums
        for num in nums:
            # Add current number to the cumulative sum
            total += num
            # Update min_val to be the minimum of current min_val and total
            min_val = min(min_val, total)
        # Return the minimum starting value such that the sum of starting value
        # and every subsequent element in nums is at least 1
        return max(1, 1 - min_val)
  #Using prefix sum helps efficiently calculate cumulative sums and find the minimum starting value startValue such that 
  the sum of startValue and every subsequent element in nums meets the requirement (in this case, at least 1). It simplifies the computation by
      reducing the need to repeatedly iterate through nums to calculate sums, making the solution more efficient and scalable for larger inputs.
